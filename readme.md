# Lets Know about these 3 in detail
1.const app = express();
const server = createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server);
You're mixing Express, HTTP, and Socket.IO, and you're asking:

## Why do we use new Server(server)? What’s the logic and flow?

✅ Step-by-Step Breakdown
🔹 1. const app = express();
This creates an Express app to handle standard HTTP requests (like GET, POST, etc.).

🔹 2. const server = createServer(app);
Express alone can't handle WebSockets (used for real-time communication).

So, you create a raw HTTP server and pass the Express app to it.

This allows both HTTP and WebSocket traffic to be handled together.

Think of this as upgrading your server to support both regular web pages and real-time messages.

🔹 3. const io = new Server(server);
Socket.IO needs a server to "attach" to so it can listen for WebSocket connections.

Server here is the Socket.IO server class (usually imported like this):

import { Server } from 'socket.io';
You create a new Socket.IO server instance bound to your HTTP server so both:

http://localhost:3000/ (HTML, CSS, JS files)

ws://localhost:3000/ (real-time WebSocket events)

are served from the same port and server.

🔧 Why Use new?
Server is a class in Socket.IO.

new Server(...) creates an instance of that class — an independent Socket.IO server object.

This object handles:

Listening for connections (io.on('connection', socket => {...}))

Sending/receiving real-time messages (socket.emit(...), socket.on(...))

So new is necessary to instantiate (create a new object from) the class.

🔁 Full Flow Summary:
Create an Express app → handles routing.

Wrap it inside an HTTP server → needed for WebSocket support.

Attach Socket.IO to that server using new Server(server) → enables real-time communication.


# Understanding io.emit() vs socket.broadcast.emit()
✅ * 1. **io.emit() — Send to EVERYONE**
js
Copy
Edit
io.emit('hello', 'world');
This sends the event 'hello' with the message 'world' to all connected clients.

Includes the sender (if called inside a .on('connection')).

🧠 Think of this like an "announcement to the whole class."

✅ 2. **socket.broadcast.emit() — Send to EVERYONE EXCEPT the sender**

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.broadcast.emit('hi');
});
When a new user connects, this sends 'hi' to everyone except that user.

Useful if you want to notify all other users that someone joined.

🧠 Think of this like whispering to everyone in the room except the person who just walked in.

✅ 3. **Full Chat Message Broadcast**

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.on('chat message', (msg) => {
    io.emit('chat message', msg);
  });
});
🔍 What's happening here?
When a client sends a chat message event, the server:

Receives the event using socket.on(...).

Broadcasts that message to all connected clients using io.emit(...).

This includes the sender, which is usually what you want for real-time chat.
